# Quick Invoice

Quick Invoice is a simple command-line based restaurant billing system written in C. This project allows users to generate invoices for a restaurant, including details such as customer name, items, quantities, prices, discounts, and taxes. It generates invoices in a `.txt` format for easy viewing and storage.

## Features

- Generate invoices with customer details, item quantities, prices, discounts, and taxes.
- Save invoices to `.txt` files for future reference.
- Load and view existing invoices.
- Search for invoices by customer name (case-insensitive).
- Display all prices in CAD (Canadian Dollars).

## How It Works

1. **Generate Invoice**: Enter customer name, item details (name, quantity, price), discount rate, and tax rate. The program will display the invoice on the screen and save it as a `.txt` file in the format `Invoice_<ID>.txt`.
2. **Load Invoice**: Enter the invoice ID to load and view a previously saved invoice.
3. **Search Invoice by Customer**: Enter the customer's name to search for invoices. The search is case-insensitive.
4. **Exit**: Close the program.

## Example Output
